# voting

create a poll in obs. probably more for non-affilate users like me.

- `!poll <Question with an '?'> option1,option2,optionN`
- chat votes with numbers 1-n
- clear user vars on vote stop and post results

## How to use

Create a blank scene and nest it in to your other scenes where you want the poll.  
Set the argument to the scene name.
Vote!
